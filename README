PyPy: Python in Python Implementation 
=====================================

Welcome to PyPy!

PyPy is both an implementation of the Python programming language, and
an extensive compiler framework for dynamic language implementations.
You can build self-contained Python implementations which execute
independently from CPython.

The home page is:

    http://pypy.org/

The getting-started document will help guide you:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html

It will also point you to the rest of the documentation which is generated
from files in the pypy/doc directory within the source repositories. Enjoy
and send us feedback!
