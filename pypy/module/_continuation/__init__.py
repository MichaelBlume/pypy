class Module(MixedModule):
    """This module exposes 'one-shot continuation containers'.

A 'continuation' object from this module is a container that stores a
one-shot continuation.  It is similar in purpose to the 'f_back'
attribute of frames, which points to where execution should continue
after this frame finishes.  The difference is that it will be changed
(often repeatedly) before the frame actually returns.

To make a 'continuation' object, call 'continuation' with a callable and
optional extra arguments.  When later you switch() to the continuation,
the callable is invoked wih the continuation as extra first argument.

At this point, the one-shot continuation stored in the continuation
container points to the caller of switch().  When switch() is called
again, this one-shot continuation is exchanged with the current one; it
means that the caller of switch() is suspended, its continuation stored
in the container, and the old continuation from the container is
resumed.

Flexible frames are internally implemented using stacklets.  Stacklets
are a bit more primitive (they are really one-shot continuations), but
that idea only works in C, not in Python, notably because of exceptions.
