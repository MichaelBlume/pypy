REVIEW NOTES
============

* Scalar.reshape should turn the value into an array correct for an input of
  ``1`` or ``(1,)``.
* VirtualSlice vs. W_NDimSlice?
* Call{1, 2}.create_sig, should it call forced_result.create_sig(), instead of
  array_sig()? If not, why not?
* W_NDimSlice.__init__ calls ConcreteArray.__init__ instead of
  ViewArray.__init__, W_FlatIterator as well.
* Better names for sigeq and sigeq2, sighash doesn't say if numberings are
  included in the hash.
* Cleanup of the iterator and array caching/numbering.  It's a mess right now:
  * _creater_iter updates the arraylist
  * Why do Scalars need an iterator at all?
  * Do views share storage with concrete arrays or other views?
