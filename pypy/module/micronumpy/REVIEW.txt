REVIEW NOTES
============

* VirtualSlice vs. W_NDimSlice?
* W_NDimSlice.__init__ calls ConcreteArray.__init__ instead of
  ViewArray.__init__, W_FlatIterator as well.
* Better names for sigeq and sigeq2, sighash doesn't say if numberings are
  included in the hash.
* Cleanup of the iterator and array caching/numbering.  It's a mess right now:
  * _creater_iter updates the arraylist
  * Why do Scalars need an iterator at all?
  * Do views share storage with concrete arrays or other views?
