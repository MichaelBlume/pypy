============

Fixed
-----
* Rather than `True if len(sep_stripped) == 0 else False` just use:
  `len(sep_stripped) == 0`.
* Rather than name the variable `A`, name it `items` or somsething like that.
* Rather than using `ptr`, use `idx`, since it's not really a pointer.
* Same comment about comparing array equality as before.
* Rather than name the attribute `char`, name it `format_code`.
* `default_fromstring` can do `self.box(-1.0)`, instead of the coerce thing.
* Rather than doing a string format to raise an error (L67), use
  `operationerrfmt`.

Notes
-----
* Tests for both bool and long dtypes with this.
  (jterrace: fromstring with bool segfaults on my numpy 1.5.1.
  Supposedly it has been fixed in later versions, but I can't
  seem to install it to check to make sure my tests are correct.
  There are already some tests for int64. Is that what you meant
  by long types?)
* No need for the `self.char == "?"` default.
  (jterrace: Does not translate without it)
