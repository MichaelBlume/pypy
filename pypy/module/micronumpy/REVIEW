* I think we should wait for indexing-by-arrays-2, since this would clean up
  the iterator interface

* I commited a failing test, it seems the entire approach is pretty doomed.
  Instead we should keep the parent iterator (and not create a OneDim one)

* For getitem, we need to reuse parent getitem, but with some hook
  that recomputes indexes. That hook would be used for any sort of access,
  be it slices or be it integers, but in general I would like to avoid code
  duplication, since the indexing is getting slowly fairly complex.
