Notes
-----
* Tests for both bool and long dtypes with this.
  (jterrace: fromstring with bool segfaults on my numpy 1.5.1.
  Supposedly it has been fixed in later versions, but I can't
  seem to install it to check to make sure my tests are correct.
  There are already some tests for int64. Is that what you meant
  by long types?)
  * http://bpaste.net/show/20968/ is a log of me playing with bool `fromstring`
    in 1.6, I can't seem to make it work with text parsing at all (or I'm an
    idiot, I'm open to both interpretations), however binary parsing works so
    maybe just do that for now.
  * by long I mean `dtype(int)`, which is different from either
    `dtype("int32")` or `dtype("int64")` (for reasons beyond my comprehension)
