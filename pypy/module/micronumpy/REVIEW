arange does not work for floats because they'll get automatically marked as ints
it also does not test that it works correctly with floats (it does not)

the flatiter should raise OperationError if object is not of BaseArray type

there are no tests for creation of numpy.flatiter

_attrs_ can be ommited entirely, but this is broken (it has to contain all attributes like __slots__)

transpose should be tested at the very least on odd number of dimensions, like 1 or 3. Ot should also handle scalar (somehow)
