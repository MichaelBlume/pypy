============

* Rather than `True if len(sep_stripped) == 0 else False` just use:
  `len(sep_stripped) == 0`.
* Rather than name the variable `A`, name it `items` or somsething like that.
* Rather than using `ptr`, use `idx`, since it's not really a pointer.
* Rather than doing a string format to raise an error (L67), use
  `operationerrfmt`.
* Same comment about comparing array equality as before.
* No need for the `self.char == "?"` default.
* Rather than name the attribute `char`, name it `format_code`.
* `default_fromstring` can do `self.box(-1.0)`, instead of the coerce thing.
* Tests for both bool and long dtypes with this.
