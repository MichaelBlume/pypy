arange(True) should return an array of ints, not bools

the flatiter should raise OperationError if object is not of BaseArray type

there are no tests for creation of numpy.flatiter

_attrs_ can be ommited entirely, but this is broken (it has to contain all attributes like __slots__)

transpose should be tested at the very least on odd number of dimensions, like 1 or 3. Ot should also handle scalar (somehow)
