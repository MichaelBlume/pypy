Please read the basics of our jit in [1]. Essentially assembler will be
specialized on greens, that's why we do the dance of all the signature stuff,
so it's compiled for each green. 'left' in green is obviously unacceptable.
I removed this but we still need signature.

More precisely - we want different assembler for the right side being Array
or View.
