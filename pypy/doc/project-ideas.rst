Potential project list
======================

This is a list of projects that are interesting for potential contributors
who are seriously interested in the PyPy project. They mostly share common
patterns - they're mid-to-large in size, they're usually well defined as
a standalone projects and they're not being actively worked on. For small
projects that you might want to work on, it's much better to either look
at the `issue tracker`_, pop up on #pypy on irc.freenode.net or write to the
`mailing list`_. This is simply for the reason that small possible projects
tend to change very rapidly.

Numpy improvements
------------------

This is more of a project-container than a single project. Possible ideas:

* experiment with auto-vectorization using SSE or implement vectorization
  without automatically detecting it for array operations.

* improve numpy, for example implement memory views.

* interface with fortran/C libraries.
