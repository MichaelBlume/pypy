PyPy 1.5: Catching Up
======================

We're pleased to announce the 1.5 release of PyPy. This release is updating
PyPy to the features of CPython 2.7.1, including the standard library. Thus the
features of `CPython 2.6`_ and `CPython 2.7`_ are now supported. It also
contains additional performance improvements. You can download it here:

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7.1. It's fast (`pypy 1.5 and cpython 2.6`_ performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

Among its new features, this release includes the features of CPython 2.6 and
2.7. It also includes a large number of small improvements to the tracing JIT
compiler.

Numerous speed achievements are described on `our blog`_. Normalized speed
charts comparing `pypy 1.5 and pypy 1.4`_ as well as `pypy 1.4 and cpython
2.6.2`_ are available on our benchmark website. The speed improvement over 1.4
seems to be around 25% on average.

More highlights
===============

- The largest change in PyPy's tracing JIT is adding support for `loop invariant
  code motion`_, which was mostly done by Håkan Ardö. This feature improves the
  performance of tight loops doing numerical calculations.

- The CPython extension module API has been improved and now supports many more
  extensions. For information on which one are supported, please refer to our
  `compatibility wiki`_.

- These changes make it possible to support `Tkinter and IDLE`_.

- The `cProfile`_ profiler is now working together with the JIT. However, it
  skews the relative performance in not yet studied ways, so that it is not yet
  a perfect tool to find subtle performance problems.

Cheers,
