# Logic to decide which loops are old and not used any more.
#
# All the long-lived references to LoopToken are weakrefs (see JitCell
# in warmstate.py), apart from the 'alive_loops' set in MemoryManager,
# which is the only (long-living) place that keeps them alive.  If a
# loop was not called for long enough, then it is removed from
# 'alive_loops'.  It will soon be freed by the GC.  LoopToken.__del__
# calls the method cpu.free_loop_and_bridges().
#
# The alive_loops set is maintained using the notion of a global
# 'current generation' which is, in practice, the total number of loops
# and bridges produced so far.  A LoopToken is declared "old" if its
# 'generation' field is much smaller than the current generation, and
# removed from the set.
