# patches for the Boehm GC for PyPy under Windows

"""
This file is obsolete now since gc-7.0 / gc-7.1 .
Please use the instructions in pypy\doc\windows.rst .

How to build a pypy compatible version of the Boehm collector
for Windows and Visual Studio .net 2003.

First of all, download the official Boehm collector suite
from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/gc.tar.gz
At the time of writing (2005-10-06) this contains version gc6.5 .

Unpack this folder somewhere, for instance to "d:\tmp".
Change to this folder using

d:
cd \tmp\gc6.5

Then copy the file NT_THREADS_MAKEFILE to Makefile:

copy NT_THREADS_MAKEFILE Makefile

This file is the general-purpose gc dll makefile. For some internal
reasons, this file's defaults are bad for PyPy. The early initialisation
in DllMain() inhibits the changes necessary for PyPy. Use this script to
do a patch: (assuming that you have d:\pypy\dist\pypy\translator\goal)

python d:\pypy\dist\pypy\translator\goal\win32\gc_patch_windows.py

Now, your makefile is patched a little bit. In particular,

ALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS   is now undefined, which PyPy wants to have
NO_GETENV               is specified, since we don't want dependencies

and the name of the .lib and .dll files is changed to gc_pypy.???

Now you need to build your gc, either as a debug or as a release
build. First of all, make sure that you have your environment prepared.
Please note that you will need to use Microsoft's cmd, as cygwin bash
doesn't correctly handle the batch file in the next step.

With my setup, I have to do

"e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin\vcvars32.bat"

After that, you can either build a release or a debug gc. 

After a successful build, you need to enable gc_pypy.dll for your compiler.
There are many ways to install this. The following recommendation just
works without changing your environment variables. I think this is the
easiest way possible, but this is a matter of taste. What I did is:

nmake CFG="gc - Win32 Release"

After the build, you will find a gc_pypy.dll file in the Release folder.
Copy this file to c:\windows\system32 or any other folder that is always
in your PATH variable.

Also, copy Release\gc_pypy.lib to (in my case)
"e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib";

finally, copy d:\tmp\gc6.5\include to
"e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\include"
and rename this folder to "gc", so that "gc/gc.h" is valid.

That's all, folks!

In case of a debug build, replace "Release" by "Debug", and also copy
gc_pypy.pdb to your lib folder. This allows you to use source-level
debugging. Please note: If you want to both build the default gc.dll
and gc_pypy.dll, please delete the Debug resp. Release folders in
between. The generated .sbr files are in the way.

Please use the above recipe and report any bugs to me.
In case of trouble, I also can provide you with pre-built dlls.
Note: We also could have solved this by including the gc source
into the PyPy build. This may or may not become necessary if something
changes dramatically, again. As long as this is not needed, I prefer
this simple solution.

Summary transcript of the steps involved: (please adjust paths)

d:
cd \tmp\gc6.5
copy NT_THREADS_MAKEFILE Makefile
python d:\pypy\dist\pypy\translator\goal\win32\gc_patch_windows.py
"e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\bin\vcvars32.bat"
nmake CFG="gc - Win32 Release"
copy Release\gc_pypy.dll c:\windows\system32
copy Release\gc_pypy.lib "e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib"
mkdir "e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\include\gc"
copy include "e:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\include\gc"
