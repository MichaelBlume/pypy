* turn calls to stm_read_word() to:
    if (d) x = stm_read_word(a); else x = *a;

  this way, gcc will optimize:
    if (d) x = stm_read_word(a); else x = *a;
    if (d) y = stm_read_word(b); else y = *b;
  to check !d only once if it is null


* PyFrames are accessed directly:

  - make the case of concurrent accesses to the same generator safe
  - make the rare other cases of concurrent accesses safe
